# Useless Trivia
This app is demo app, made to make my acquaintance with the Dart/Flutter platform. It has some basic UI things, like the equivalent of a recylerview in Flutter. It has an implementation of a database, a REST-api, and uses the Flutter Bloc Design pattern. More info on that here: 
https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-presentation-layer/

In short, it has all the basic ingredients of a proper Flutter application. 

As it was solely made for myself, the commit messages are short and nonsensical.
